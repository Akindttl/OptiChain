OptiChain: Supply Chain Optimization with Predictive Analytics Smart Contract
=============================================================================

OptiChain is an advanced smart contract designed to revolutionize end-to-end supply chain management by integrating **AI-powered predictive analytics** directly on the blockchain. This contract provides a secure, transparent, and automated ecosystem for managing products, suppliers, and shipments while leveraging machine learning models for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, risk assessment, and intelligent supplier selection. By deploying on a decentralized network, OptiChain ensures data integrity and trust across all supply chain participants, enabling data-driven decisions and significant operational efficiencies.

üöÄ Features
-----------

OptiChain is built with a modular and scalable architecture to provide a comprehensive suite of supply chain management tools.

### **1\. AI-Powered Predictive Modeling**

-   **Predictive Demand Forecasting:** Utilizes external data and historical trends to predict future demand with a high degree of confidence. This feature helps prevent stockouts and overstocking.

-   **Inventory Optimization:** Automatically calculates optimal inventory levels based on real-time data and demand forecasts, minimizing holding costs and improving fulfillment rates.

-   **Automated Supplier Selection:** Employs a multi-dimensional scoring algorithm to rank suppliers based on key metrics like cost-efficiency, quality, and delivery performance.

-   **Risk Assessment and Mitigation:** Proactively assesses supply chain risks, such as supplier unreliability or disruptions, and recommends mitigation strategies.

### **2\. Core Supply Chain Management**

-   **Supplier Registration:** Onboard new suppliers with detailed performance metrics.

-   **Product Management:** Track products with real-time inventory levels, quality scores, and unit costs.

-   **Shipment Tracking:** Create and monitor shipments with unique tracking hashes, costs, and delivery status.

### **3\. Transparency and Security**

-   All transactions and data updates are recorded immutably on the blockchain, providing a single source of truth for all supply chain activities.

-   The use of cryptographic hashes ensures the integrity of shipment tracking information.

### **4\. Cost and Performance Optimization**

-   **Cost Optimization:** Algorithms are integrated to identify and recommend cost-saving opportunities.

-   **Performance Analytics:** Provides comprehensive reports on key performance indicators (KPIs) like on-time delivery rates, quality scores, and overall supply chain value.

üîí Private Functions (Internal Logic)
-------------------------------------

The following functions handle the core logic and calculations within the smart contract. They cannot be called directly from outside the contract.

### **`calculate-supplier-score`**

Calculates a comprehensive weighted score for a supplier based on cost, quality, and delivery performance. This score is used internally for supplier optimization.

### **`update-inventory-optimization`**

Adjusts the `optimal-inventory` level for a product based on its `demand-forecast`, incorporating a safety stock buffer. This ensures the system always has a target inventory to work toward.

### **`assess-supply-risk`**

Determines the risk level (`LOW_RISK`, `MODERATE_RISK`, `HIGH_RISK`, or `UNKNOWN_RISK`) of a supplier based on their reliability and quality scores.

üõ†Ô∏è Public Functions
--------------------

### **`register-supplier`**

Registers a new supplier with initial performance metrics. Only the `CONTRACT-OWNER` can call this function.

-   **Parameters:**

    -   `name` (string-ascii 50): The name of the supplier.

    -   `reliability` (uint): A score from 0 to 100 for supplier reliability.

    -   `quality` (uint): A score from 0 to 100 for product quality.

    -   `cost-efficiency` (uint): A score from 0 to 100 for cost efficiency.

    -   `delivery-performance` (uint): A score from 0 to 100 for delivery performance.

-   **Returns:** `(ok uint)` with the new supplier ID.

### **`add-product`**

Adds a new product to the supply chain.

-   **Parameters:**

    -   `name` (string-ascii 50): The name of the product.

    -   `category` (string-ascii 30): The product category.

    -   `initial-inventory` (uint): The starting inventory count.

    -   `unit-cost` (uint): The cost per unit.

    -   `supplier-id` (uint): The ID of the primary supplier.

-   **Returns:** `(ok uint)` with the new product ID.

### **`create-shipment`**

Initiates a new shipment for a product from a specific supplier.

-   **Parameters:**

    -   `product-id` (uint): The ID of the product being shipped.

    -   `supplier-id` (uint): The ID of the supplier.

    -   `quantity` (uint): The number of units in the shipment.

    -   `expected-delivery` (uint): The anticipated delivery date (block height).

    -   `cost` (uint): The total cost of the shipment.

-   **Returns:** `(ok uint)` with the new shipment ID.

### **`update-demand-prediction`**

Updates the demand forecast for a product using a new predictive model result. Requires a minimum confidence level.

-   **Parameters:**

    -   `product-id` (uint): The product to update.

    -   `forecast-period` (uint): The period for the forecast.

    -   `predicted-demand` (uint): The new predicted demand value.

    -   `confidence-level` (uint): The confidence level of the prediction (min. `PREDICTION-CONFIDENCE-THRESHOLD`).

-   **Returns:** `(ok true)` on success.

### **`execute-predictive-supply-chain-optimization-and-automation`**

Executes a full-scale, multi-dimensional analysis and optimization cycle of the entire supply chain. This is the contract's main engine. Only the `CONTRACT-OWNER` can call this.
